Hi $user_name,

This is just a friendly reminder that you have $number running instance${s} in $cloud $profile account${ss}:

$table

Make sure any running instances are either STOPPED or TERMINATED before close of business.

If you wish to keep your instances running for longer than $warning_threshold hours, please raise a ticket at https://helpdesk.wandisco.com and we will exclude them from reporting.

Please note:
- any unexcluded instances running for longer than $warning_threshold hours will be reported to the respective head of department
- any unexcluded instances running for longer than $critical_threshold hours will be automatically STOPPED.

For more information check our $cloud Best Practices at $bp_url.

Thank you.
